	abstract = {Student attitudes toward aggression have been linked to individual aggressive behavior, but the relationship between school-wide normative beliefs about aggression and aggressive behavior poses some important measurement challenges that have not been adequately examined. The current study investigated the factor structure, measurement invariance, and criterion-related validity of a six-item Aggressive Attitudes scale using a large sample of seventh- and eighth-grade students (n = 39,364) from 423 schools. Analytic procedures accounted for the frequently ignored modeling problems of clustered and ordinal data to provide more reliable and accurate model estimates and standard errors. The resulting second-order factor structure of the Aggressive Attitudes scale demonstrated measurement invariance across gender, grade, and race/ethnicity groups. Criterion-related validity was supported with eight student- and school-level indices of aggressive behavior.},

	abstract = {A variety of health and social problems are routinely measured in the form of categorical outcome data (such as presence/absence of a problem behavior or stages of disease progression). Therefore, proper quantitative analysis of categorical data lies at the heart of the empirical work conducted in prevention science. Categorical data analysis constitutes a broad dynamic field of methods research and data analysts in prevention science can benefit from incorporating recent advances and developments in the statistical evaluation of categorical outcomes in their methodological repertoire. The present Special Issue, Advanced Categorical Data Analysis in Prevention Science, highlights recent methods developments and illustrates their application in the context of prevention science. Contributions of the Special Issue cover a wide variety of areas ranging from statistical models for binary as well as multi-categorical data, advances in the statistical evaluation of moderation and mediation effects for categorical data, developments in model evaluation and measurement, as well as methods that integrate variable- and person-oriented categorical data analysis. The articles of this Special issue make methodological advances in these areas accessible to the audience of prevention scientists to maintain rigorous statistical practice and decision making. The current paper provides background and rationale for this Special Issue, an overview of the articles, and a brief discussion of some potential future directions for prevention research involving categorical data analysis.},

	abstract = {Homogeneity of variance (HOV) is a well-known but often untested assumption in the context of multilevel models (MLMs). However, depending on how large the violation is, how different group sizes are, and the variance pairing, standard errors can be over or underestimated even when using MLMs, resulting in questionable inferential tests. We evaluate several tests (e.g., the H statistic, Breusch Pagan, Leveneâ€™s test) that can be used with MLMs to assess violations of HOV. Although the traditional robust standard errors used with MLMs require at least 50 clusters to be effective, we assess a robust standard error adjustment (i.e., the CR2 estimator) that can be used even with a few clusters. Findings are assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation and are further illustrated using an applied example. We show that explicitly modeling the heterogenous variance structures or using the CR2 estimator are both effective at ameliorating the issues associated with the fixed effects of the regression model related to violations of HOV resulting from between-group differences.},

The study presents findings from a cluster randomized, controlled trial conducted with 2,248 students from grades 5 to 12 (38\% Black, 32\% Hispanic) attending 18 schools in the U.S. Northeast. After 1 year of implementation, the experimental analyses of the whole-school initiative did not result in more positive perceptions of school climate for students in the intervention schools compared with students in the control schools. Correlational analyses were also conducted with student surveys in both intervention and control schools. Based on student report, restorative practice exposure in all 18 schools was associated with positive perceptions of the school climate. This suggests that initiatives may need to focus on fidelity of implementation and consistent implementation across more years for substantive school climate gains.},
