## R packages

ðŸ“¦ **CR2**: Compute CR0, CR1, CR2 cluster robust standard errors with empirical-degrees of freedom adjustments. (July 2022).

This is now on CRAN so can be installed using: install.packages('CR2'). 

{{<figure src="https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/CR2" >}}{{<figure src="https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/CR2" >}}

The SPSS version is available [here](https://github.com/flh3/CR2/tree/master/SPSS).

ðŸ“¦ **gendata**: Generate and modify synthetic datasets. Create synthetic datasets based on a correlation table. Additional functions can be used to rescale, transform, and reverse code variables.

ðŸ“¦ **hornpa**: A stand-alone function that generates a user specified number of random datasets and computes eigenvalues using the random datasets (i.e., implements Horn's [1965, Psychometrika] parallel analysis).

## Shiny

Testing out Shiny-- a web application framework for R. 

Conduct a [parallel analysis](https://grumble.shinyapps.io/Parallel_analysis/) online to determine the number of components/factors to retain. No need to download any syntax files or packages. _NOTE: For some reason, the EFA PA is not working properly_ (but it does in the package).

## Conducting multilevel CFA in R

I wrote a short note a while back (which I've kept updating) on conducting a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis using R (with *lavaan*). The note and the directions on using the function can be found using this [link](../docs/MCFAinRHUANG.pdf). NOTE: the updated version of *lavaan* now has a feature that automates the cumbersome multilevel setup. Additional notes can be found [here](https://francish.netlify.com/post/multilevel-cfa-mlf/).
