I show this in a recent JEBS article on using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs). Shown below is some annotated syntax and examples. 

> Huang, F. (2021). Analyzing cross-sectionally clustered data using generalized estimating equations. *Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics.* doi: 10.3102/10769986211017480

In the original paper draft, I had a section which showed how much more widely used mixed models (i.e., MLMs, HLMs) were compared to GEEs but was asked to remove that (to save space). I thought the usage was interesting so I am including it here:

In psychology, mixed model studies are much more popular than studies using GEEs by a ratio of 15:1 (Bauer & Sterba, 2011)

Citations in JEBS:

- In the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics (JEBS): one article on how to use multilevel models by Singer (1998) has over 3,300 citations (as of 2020.06.11, Google Scholar)

- In the same journal, Ghisletta & Sini (2004) provided an introduction to GEEs. This article has 329 citations. GS wrote (p. 431):

> Although GEEs are widely applied in biological, pharmacological, and closely related disciplines, their application in educational and social sciences remains relatively scarce.

There is a difference of 6 years but the Singer article has been cited over **10** times more! If using average citations per year, **7.5** times more.

## Solving GEEs using IRLS

This example is only for an identity link using either an independence or exchangeable working correlation matrix.

1. Initial estimates for $\beta$ are estimated using a standard GLM (with an independence
correlation structure). Residuals are obtained. If an independence working correlation
structure is specified, these are also the final estimates, go to Step 7.

2. Using the residuals, $\alpha$ is estimated. An example of how this is computed with an
exchangeable correlation matrix is shown in Hardin and Hilbe (2013, pp. 65â€“67),
and we show this in our syntax as well.

3. The working exchangeable correlation matrix is updated to include a in the off
diagonals. The correlation matrix is converted to a covariance matrix, $V_j$, based on
the variance of the outcome. An overall $V$ block diagonal matrix is formed which
has the same $V_j$ for every cluster.

4. When using an identity link, new coefficients are reestimated using
$\hat{\beta} = (X'V^{-1}X)^{-1}X'V^{-1}y$

5. New residuals are obtained using the updated $\beta$.

6. Steps 2â€“5 are repeated until some convergence criteria are met (e.g., for continuous
outcomes, minimal changes in the sum of squared residuals).

7. Compute and apply cluster-robust/empirical standard errors based on formulas
also developed by Liang and Zeger (1986). CRSEs can be written as: $(X'X)^{-1}\hat{\Omega}(X'X)^{-1}$ where $\hat{\Omega}=\sum^{J}_{j=1}X^{'}_j\hat{u}_j\hat{u}_j'X_j$ and $\hat{u}_j$ are the residuals from the observations in cluster $j$.

## ICC estimation based on residuals

This example shows how to compute the exchangeable correlation coefficient (ICC) based on residuals. This is a different approach from using the between and within group variance components in a mixed model. This comes from Hardin and Hilbe's (2013) book on *Generalized Estimating Equations, 2nd edition*. Crespi et al. (2011) and Wu et al. (2012) show how there can be several approaches in computing the ICC/exchangeable correlation coefficient. 


``` r
NG = 2
id <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2)
t <- c(1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4) 
y <- c(4,5,6,7,5,6,7,8) 
x <- c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)
dat <- data.frame(id, t, y, x)
```

- Scale parameter ($\phi$) must be estimated.
- NG = number of groups.
- GS = group size. Number of observations in the cluster.

$$
\hat{\phi} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^{NG}_{i=1}\sum^{GS}_{t=1}\text{res}^2_{it} 
$$
This is just the mean of the squared (Pearson) residuals. A basic OLS regression is used:


``` r
m1 <- lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
res <- resid(m1) #vector
dat$res <- res #save it into the original dataset
(scalep = mean(res^2)) #scale parameter
```

```
[1] 1.25
```

``` r
dat
```

```
  id t y x  res
1  1 1 4 0 -1.5
2  1 2 5 1 -1.5
3  1 3 6 0  0.5
4  1 4 7 1  0.5
5  2 1 5 0 -0.5
6  2 2 6 1 -0.5
7  2 3 7 0  1.5
8  2 4 8 1  1.5
```

The exchangeable correlation coefficient (e.g., compound symmetry, common correlation, equal correlation) can be estimated using (formula 3.28 in the HH book). This can be thought of as the intraclass correlation coefficient and at times can be seen as $\rho$ or $\alpha$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\rho} &= \hat{\phi}^{-1}\frac{1}{12}\sum^{NG}_{i=1}\sum^{GS}_{t=1}\sum_{t'>t}\text{res}_{it}\text{res}_{it'} \\
&= \frac{1}{1.25}\frac{1}{12}\{[-1.5(-1.5+.5+.5) - 1.5(.5+.5) + .5(.5)] + 
[-.5(-.5+1.5+1.5)-.5(1.5+1.5)+1.5(1.5)]\} \\
&= .8\frac{1}{12}([-.5] + [.5]) \\
&= -.06667
\end{aligned}
$$
So we need to get the residuals per group

``` r
rpg <- split(res, dat$id)
nm <- names(table(dat$id))
r1 <- rpg[[1]] #residuals from first group
egeg <- r1 %*% t(r1) #quicker way to do this, orig a loop
(forg1 = sum(egeg[lower.tri(egeg)]))
```

```
[1] -0.5
```

``` r
r2 <- rpg[[2]] #residuals from second group
egeg2 <- r2 %*% t(r2) #quicker way to do this, orig a loop
(forg2 = sum(egeg2[lower.tri(egeg2)]))
```

```
[1] -0.5
```

``` r
(1/scalep) * (1/12) * (forg1 + forg2) #putting it all together
```

```
[1] -0.06666667
```

The 12 is based on the number of residuals we have multiplied and added together. In a 4 x 4 matrix, there are 6 pieces of unique information. Since had two groups, this is 12 in total.

Putting this together in a function:


``` r
geticc <- function(data, cluster, r){
  
  scalep <- mean(r^2) #dispersion parameter
  rpg <- split(r, data[,cluster]) #individual residuals
  nm <- names(table(data[,cluster])) #names of clusters
  coll <- numeric() #empty container
  
  ### p. 63 Hardin and Hilbe
  ### get ICC based on residuals per cluster
  ### right now, need the data to be sorted by cluster
  
  multresid <- function(x){
    r2 <- rpg[[x]] #extract resid per group (rpg)
    egeg <- r2 %*% t(r2) #e %*% t(e)
    coll[x] <- sum(egeg[lower.tri(egeg)]) #only lower diag
  }
  
  tst <- sum(sapply(nm, multresid)) #how many per group 
  ns <- sapply(rpg, length) #add up how many were added
  den <- sum((ns * (ns - 1 )) / 2) #how many products were added
  icc.model <- (tst / den) * (1 / scalep) #the icc
  return(icc.model)
  
}
```

Using the function:


``` r
geticc(dat, 'id', res)
```

```
[1] -0.06666667
```

Comparing the output using the `geeglm` function in the `geepack` package. $\alpha$ and $\rho$ are at times used interchangeably. 


``` r
library(geepack)
test <- geeglm(y ~ x, id = id, corstr = 'exchangeable', family = gaussian, data = dat)
summary(test)
```

```

Call:
geeglm(formula = y ~ x, family = gaussian, data = dat, id = id, 
    corstr = "exchangeable")

## Example with a homemade GEE function

This syntax is not made for speed, but for transparency (i.e., hopefully, the steps can be seen).


``` r

  tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$cluster), ] #sorting by cluster
  fml <- formula(fml)
  df <- model.frame(fml, tmp)
  X <- model.matrix(fml, df)
  y <- model.response(df)

  if(sum(is.na(df)) > 0) (stop("You have missing data."))
  
  gpsz <- table(data[, cluster]) #how many per group; group size
  NG <- length(gpsz) #how many groups
  maxsize <- max(gpsz) #what's the biggest group size
  
  CS <- c('independence', 'exchangeable')
  cs <- pmatch(corstr, CS, -1) #allow to match corstr by keywords
  if (cs == -1) (stop("Currently can only use an independence or exchangeable correlation structure"))
  
  corstr <- CS[cs] #put in the whole word
  
  # STEP #1
  firstrun <- glm(formula(fml), data = df) #just a regular glm
  
  # STEP #2
  r <- resid(firstrun, 'pearson') #get residuals
  betas <- coef(firstrun) #get initial coefficients
  
  if (corstr == 'exchangeable') {

  ### setup iterations need for exchangeable structure

    i = 1 #starting at iteration 1
    
    cat("Iteration: ") 
    while(abs(delta.dev > tol & i < maxiter)){ #when change in deviance is small, stop
      cat(i, "::")
      
      # after iteration, this is STEP #5
      r <- y - X %*% betas #residuals / use Pearson if non-identity link
      
      icc <- geticc(data = tmp, 'cluster', r) #compute new iccs #going back to step #2

    }
    
    cat("\nFinal alpha:", icc, "\n")

  ### STEP #7: computing Liang and Zeger SEs
  re <- as.numeric(y - X %*% betas) #get residuals

  if (corstr == 'exchangeable') wcv <- results$wcv
  
  for(i in 1:NG){
      tmp <- nrow((df[gpsv == gs[i], ]))
      u[i,] <- t(cdata$r[cdata$cluster == gs[i]]) %*% 
        solve(wcv[1:tmp, 1:tmp]) %*% X[gpsv == gs[i], 1:k]
  }
  
  mt <- crossprod(u) #t(u) %*% u :: meat
  br <- solve(t(X) %*% vm2 %*% X) #bread matrix
  clvc <- br %*% mt %*% br #LZ robust vcov matrix
  
  ### putting it all together
  
  se <- as.numeric(sqrt(diag(clvc))) #standard error
  b <- as.numeric(betas) #betas
  wald <- (b / se)^2 #wald
  pv <- pchisq(wald, 1, lower.tail = F) #p value
  stars <- cut(pv, breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1), 
               labels = c("***", "**", "*  ", ".  ", " "), 
               include.lowest = TRUE)

  row.names(res) <- colnames(X) #getting the names of the coefficients

## only for creating an exchangeable R matrix
