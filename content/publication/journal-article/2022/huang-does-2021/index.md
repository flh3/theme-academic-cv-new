abstract: Due to the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the use of
  protective measures (e.g., mask wearing and social distancing) has become an important
  public health concern. Despite being an effective and low-cost measure, mask wearing
  in the U.S. is a contentious issue. We investigated data coming from a natural experiment
  ( n = 1,993) collected in a Midwestern state where survey questions about mask wearing
  and COVID-19 were presented in a random order. Primed respondents ( n = 1,011),
  who answered COVID-19 related questions prior to the mask questions, indicated no
  differences in the efficacy of masks in stopping the spread of the virus compared
  to nonprimed respondents ( n = 982). However, primed respondents who were not worried
  about getting sick were 37% less likely to believe in the efficacy of masks compared
  the nonprimed, nonworried respondents. Nonworried respondents represent a high-risk
  group who are likely not to wear a mask. Implications for the messages used in public
  health campaigns to elicit a change in behaviors are discussed.
