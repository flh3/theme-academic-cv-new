abstract: Studentâ€“teacher relationships (STRs) and socioeconomic status (SES) are
  two widely studied variables that have been found to predict reading achievement
  in the early grades. The current study extends the literature by investigating the
  interaction between STRs, measured using the STR Scale completed by teachers, and
  SES on reading achievement using a nationally representative data set. The study
  included approximately 8,380 first-grade students and 2,930 teachers, from 860 schools,
  representing a weighted sample of 3.15 million students. Results from multilevel
  modeling that controlled for student-, teacher-, and school-level factors found
  that both STRs and SES were strongly associated with student reading achievement.
  There was also a statistically significant interaction between close STRs and SES
  on reading achievement, suggesting that less conflictual STRs were associated with
  increased reading achievement scores for all students, but were particularly beneficial
  for students from low SES backgrounds. Educational implications are provided.
