 abstract = {To address the need for brief teacher stress interventions, the study aimed to evaluate a bibliotherapy-based stress management training for teachers using a randomized control design (N = 52). The intervention reduced stress (d = −0.43) and mental health symptoms (d's = −0.50 - 0.60) and improved a spectrum of specific coping skills (d's = 0.62–1.35). However, the intervention did not improve teacher satisfaction, efficacy, or classroom management; additional contextual or training supports are likely needed to improve these outcomes. Findings were largely replicated with the wait-list group. This brief, feasible program has promise for widespread dissemination to improve teacher stress and well-being.},
