abstract: The beneficial relationship of school climate with various positive student
  outcomes has been demonstrated in several studies, though the relationship has not
  been thoroughly explored with regards to a studentâ€™s likelihood of being suspended
  from school. The relationship of school climate and out-of-school suspensions was
  investigated using a nationally-representative sample of 10th grade students. Regression
  results, which included student- and school-level factors, indicated that an authoritative
  school climate, characterized by an environment with fair and just rules, was associated
  with the reduced likelihood of suspensions, over and above other predictors. Although
  the relationship may be characterized as small (OR = 0.82), the positive benefits
  to students are likely cumulative over each year the student is in school.
