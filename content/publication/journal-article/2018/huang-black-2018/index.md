abstract: Black students are much more likely to be disciplined using out-of-school
  suspensions (OSS) compared with White students. One often-cited hypothesis, though
  relatively untested, is the role of misconduct and students attitudes that support
  deviant behavior. The differential involvement hypothesis suggests that disproportionate
  sanctioning may result if one group of students is engaged in greater levels of
  misbehavior compared with the other group. Using a national high school dataset,
  the author used various student-reported measures of misconduct (e.g., fighting)
  and 18 attitudes supporting deviant behavior (e.g., it is okay to disobey school
  rules) to investigate their association with receiving an OSS. Findings showed that
  misconduct and deviant attitudes were important factors in predicting the receipt
  of OSS though results indicated that Black students did not generally misbehave
  or endorse deviant attitudes more than White students did.
