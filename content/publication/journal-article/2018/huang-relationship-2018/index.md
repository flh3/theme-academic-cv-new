abstract: Out-of-school suspension (OSS), particularly for Black students, is recognized
  as a serious concern given the many negative consequences associated with being
  removed from school. This study tested the hypothesis that an authoritative school
  climate (ASC), characterized by strict but fair discipline and supportive teacher-student
  relationships, was associated with a lower likelihood of suspensions. Logistic regression
  models were used to analyze cross-sectional, student-report survey data from a statewide
  sample of 75,081 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students from 310 middle schools. Results
  indicated that, after controlling for student and school characteristics, higher
  ASC was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving an OSS. The beneficial association
  of an ASC did not vary differentially by student race/ethnicity.
