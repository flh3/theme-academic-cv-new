 abstract = {Out-of-school suspension (OSS), particularly for Black students, is recognized as a serious concern given the many negative consequences associated with being removed from school. This study tested the hypothesis that an authoritative school climate (ASC), characterized by strict but fair discipline and supportive teacher-student relationships, was associated with a lower likelihood of suspensions. Logistic regression models were used to analyze cross-sectional, student-report survey data from a statewide sample of 75,081 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students from 310 middle schools. Results indicated that, after controlling for student and school characteristics, higher ASC was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving an OSS. The beneficial association of an ASC did not vary differentially by student race/ethnicity.},
