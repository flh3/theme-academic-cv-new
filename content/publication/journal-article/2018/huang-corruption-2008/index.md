abstract: Corruption is a problem that continues to plague developed and developing
  countries worldwide. Previous studies have explored the negative implications of
  corruption on several aspects of human development, but, despite its serious and
  long-lasting consequences, the impact of corruption on educational outcomes has
  started to receive attention only in recent years. This study empirically investigates
  the relationship between corruption and educational outcomes, using a sample of
  50 countries. Study findings show that corruption is negatively associated with
  educational outcomes, after controlling for other variables, and suggest that continued
  efforts be made to control corruption. (Contains 3 tables and 7 endnotes.)
