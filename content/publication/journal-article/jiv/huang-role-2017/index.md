abstract: Violence directed toward teachers in schools is relatively understudied
  in comparison with other school-based forms of peer aggression (e.g., school bullying).
  Based on the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 2011-2012,
  approximately 10% of K-12 public school teachers in the United States, received
  a threat in the past 12 months and 6% reported being physically attacked. The effects
  of teacher-directed violence are far reaching and affect not just the victimized
  teacher, but the larger community itself. In the current study, we used multilevel
  logistic regression models with state fixed effects to analyze the SASS data set.
  The analytic sample consisted of 24,070 K-12 teachers in 4,610 public schools and
  specifically excluded special education teachers and teachers in alternative settings
  (i.e., online schools, special education centers, juvenile correction facilities).
  Guided by authoritative school climate theory, we tested for the beneficial associations
  of disciplinary structure and administrative support with the reduced likelihood
  of a teacher being threatened or physically attacked by a student, while controlling
  for teacher (e.g., gender, years of experience, race/ethnicity), school (e.g., school
  size, percent minority enrollment), and state-level factors. Results indicated that
  teachers who felt supported by the administration and worked with others (i.e.,
  the principal and other teachers) who enforced the rules consistently were less
  likely to be victims of threats of injury or physical attacks. Although school climate
  has been shown to have a positive effect on student outcomes, the current study
  also suggests that school climate, characterized by consistent rule enforcement
  and supportive administrators and teachers, may play a role in reducing the likelihood
  of teacher victimization.
