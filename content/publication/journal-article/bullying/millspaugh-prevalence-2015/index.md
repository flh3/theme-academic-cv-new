abstract: 'Violence prevention strategies such as threat assessment rely on information
  from students; however, students are often unwilling to report threats of violence
  to school authorities. The current study investigated the hypothesis that middle
  school students are less likely to report threats of violence when they perceive
  aggressive behavior as a source of status and popularity among their peers. Our
  statewide sample consisted of 39,364 7th and 8th graders who completed school climate
  surveys in 423 schools. Students completed a measure of aggressive attitudes and
  were asked how much they agreed or disagreed with 2 statements concerning threats
  of violence: (a) “If another student brought a gun to school, I would tell one of
  the teachers or staff at school,” and (b) “If another student talked about killing
  someone, I would tell one of the teachers or staff at school.” Multilevel logistic
  regression analyses, which controlled for student and school demographics, found
  that higher levels of aggressive attitudes at both the school and student level
  were associated with a lower likelihood of reporting threat behavior.'
