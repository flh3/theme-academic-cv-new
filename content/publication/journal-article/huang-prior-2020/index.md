abstract: At the end of 2018, Obama-era disciplinary guidance aimed at reducing the
  use of suspensions in schools (especially for minorities and students with disabilities)
  was revoked by the U.S. Department of Education. A key piece of research supporting
  the decision was based on the analyses of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,
  Kindergarten Class of 1998â€“1999 (ECLS-K), which showed that the racial suspension
  gap was not really about race but resulted from the differential behavior exhibited
  by Black and White students. We reanalyzed the public-use ECLS-K and provide syntax
  for our analyses to show that the findings were primarily due to sample selection
  bias. Several alternative model specifications were tested and continued to show
  the persistence of the race-based suspension gaps regardless of model or measure
  used.
