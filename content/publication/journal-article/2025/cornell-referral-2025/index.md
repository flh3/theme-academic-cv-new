abstract: Although behavioral threat assessment and management (often shortened
  to “threat assessment”) has become widely used in US schools, no studies have systematically
  examined how frequently schools conduct threat assessments and how threat assessment
  rates vary as a function of student and school demographics. Of particular concern
  is that students with disabilities receive threat assessments at disproportionately
  high rates. This study examined the 1‐year frequency of threat assessments in a
  statewide sample of 611 elementary, 341 middle, and 269 high schools reporting 15,301
  threat assessments, of which 41% concerned students with disabilities. We identified
  threat assessment rate differences associated with student grade, gender, race/ethnicity,
  and disability status. We further examined the association between threat assessment
  rates and school‐level demographic characteristics including racial/ethnic composition,
  prevalence of economically disadvantaged students, and proportion of students with
  a disability. To place these results in context, we compared findings for threat
  assessment with out‐of‐school suspension rates. We discuss reasons why students
  with disabilities might be referred for BTAM at a high rate and recommend practices
  for assuring their educational rights and needs are safeguarded. Evolving school
  threat assessment policies should recognize the practice demands placed on school
  staff to evaluate a substantial number of students. ,  Summary    Schools using
  BTAM can expect to evaluate approximately 1.5% of their student enrollment in one
  school year, with lower rates in high schools.   BTAM can help schools avoid overreacting
  to student threats that are not serious.   Students with disabilities constitute
  approximately 41% of referrals, so teams must consider the role of their disability
  and coordinate their recommendations with the special education process.
