abstract: Threat assessment is a violence prevention strategy used to investigate
  and respond to threats to harm others. In 2013, Virginia mandated the use of threat
  assessment teams for threats to self and to others, effectively subsuming suicide
  assessment with threat assessment and raising questions about the distinction between
  the two practices. In a statewide sample of 2,861 cases from 926 schools, there
  were more threats to self (60%) than others (35%), with only 5% involving threats
  to both self and others. Threats to self were more likely to be made by females
  (odds ratio [OR] = 3.38) and students with fewer prior disciplinary actions (OR
  = 0.48). Threats to self were much less likely to involve a weapon (OR = 0.07),
  but more likely to be attempted (OR = 1.50) and result in mental health services
  (OR = 2.96). They were much less likely to result in out-of-school suspensions (OR
  = 0.07), legal action (OR = 0.17), and/or changes in placement (OR = 0.53). Overall,
  these findings support a clear distinction between suicide and threat assessment.
