abstract: Purpose Although studies have documented that Black students receive out-of-school
  suspensions (OSS) at much higher rates than White students, few studies have investigated
  possible explanations for this disparity. The differential involvement hypothesis
  suggests that disproportionate sanctioning may be a function of racial differences
  in student misbehavior or characteristics that predispose them to misbehavior. Method
  Suspension data, risk behaviors, and aggressive attitudes from self-report surveys
  were collected from a statewide sample of 38,398 students attending 236 racially-diverse
  high schools. A series of school fixed-effect logistic and linear regression models
  were used to test behavioral and attitudinal forms of the differential involvement
  hypothesis. Results Racial differences in self-reported suspension could not be
  explained by different behavioral reasons for suspension (such as fighting, threatening
  others, and substance possession), by involvement in high risk behaviors of fighting,
  bullying, carrying a weapon, consuming alcohol, or using marijuana, or by aggressive
  attitudes that lead to hostile behavior. Conclusions Overall, these findings do
  not support the differential involvement hypothesis and although they do not establish
  the presence of bias, they strengthen concern that racial disparities are likely
  the result of differential decisions by school authorities.
