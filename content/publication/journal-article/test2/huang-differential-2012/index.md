abstract: This study investigated the differential and persistent effects of a state-funded
  pre-K program, the Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI). We analyzed data from a
  cohort of over 60,000 students nested in approximately 1000 schools from the beginning
  of kindergarten to the end of first grade using two-level hierarchical logistic
  regression models. While controlling for student- and school-level variables, we
  found that attending a VPI-funded program was beneficially associated with a lower
  likelihood of repeating kindergarten and improved probabilities of meeting or exceeding
  minimum literacy competencies. The benefits of attending pre-K were greatest upon
  kindergarten entry and persisted until the end of the first grade for Hispanic and
  Black students, as well as for students with disabilities, despite VPI-funded program
  attendees going to schools with higher concentrations of poverty.
