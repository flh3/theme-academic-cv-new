abstract: National debate over law enforcement in schools has largely overlooked student
  reporting of violent threats to school resource officer (SROs). This statewide assessment
  of Virginia high school students (n = 99,358) found that the majority of Black (64%),
  Hispanic (72%), White (71%), and other racial/ethnic identity (71%) students agreed
  the SRO made them feel safer at school. Logistic regressions revealed that positive
  perceptions of the SRO and frequency of speaking with the SRO were associated with
  increased willingness to report a peer who brought a gun to school or talked about
  killing someone. Perceptions of the SRO interacted with student race/ethnicity such
  that favorable views reduced disparities in nonwhite studentsâ€™ willingness to report
  a peer with a gun. Although correlational, these results suggest that positive relationships
  with SROs encourage students to report threats of peer violence.
