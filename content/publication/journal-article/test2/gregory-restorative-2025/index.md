abstract: Few school districts systematically record characteristics of restorative
  justice conferences and elicit participant perceptions. As a result, there is a
  lack of research on conference characteristics and the social validity of this problem-solving
  process. We leveraged a unique dataset from a large Mid-Atlantic, U.S. school district.
  We found evidence that restorative conferences can have good social validity, based
  on 481 student survey responses that aligned with restorative values and suggested
  high quality implementation. In addition, our review of 365 records found variability
  in the use of conferences across (a) schools, (b) grade levels, and (c) an early
  and later intervention continuum. Patterns of use also suggested marginalized groups
  had access to this positive approach to resolving conflict. At the same time, conference
  use across groups reflected nationwide trends in racial/ethnic and special education
  disproportionality in discipline.
