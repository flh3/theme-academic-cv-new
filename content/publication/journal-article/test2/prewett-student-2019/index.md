abstract: This study investigated 336 fifth- and sixth-grade middle school students'
  relationships with their ten mathematics teachers. Authors used a five-step hierarchical
  multiple linear regression to examine teacher and student factors related to students'
  quality of relationships with their teachers. Analyses revealed that teachers' student
  relationship perceptions positively predicted their students' perceptions and the
  students' reports of their mathematics interest and self-efficacy positively predicted
  teacher relationships. Teachers' prosocial classroom behavior and social-emotional
  support behaviors were the strongest predictors of students' views of high quality
  relationships with their teachers; both prosocial classroom behaviors and social-emotional
  support are malleable, and authors discuss implications for how teachers' behaviors
  shape students' positive views of their student-teacher relationships.
