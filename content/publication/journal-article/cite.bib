	abstract = {Abstract
            The use of large-scale assessments (LSAs) in education has grown in the past decade though analysis of LSAs using multilevel models (MLMs) using R has been limited. A reason for its limited use may be due to the complexity of incorporating both plausible values and weighted analyses in the multilevel analyses of LSA data. We provide additional functions in R that extend the functionality of the WeMix (Bailey et al., 2023) package to allow for the automatic pooling of plausible values. In addition, functions for model comparisons using plausible values and the ability to export output to different formats (e.g., Word, html) are also provided.},

The study presents findings from a cluster randomized, controlled trial conducted with 2,248 students from grades 5 to 12 (38\% Black, 32\% Hispanic) attending 18 schools in the U.S. Northeast. After 1 year of implementation, the experimental analyses of the whole-school initiative did not result in more positive perceptions of school climate for students in the intervention schools compared with students in the control schools. Correlational analyses were also conducted with student surveys in both intervention and control schools. Based on student report, restorative practice exposure in all 18 schools was associated with positive perceptions of the school climate. This suggests that initiatives may need to focus on fidelity of implementation and consistent implementation across more years for substantive school climate gains.},

	abstract = {Internalizing problems are common mental health concerns among children and youth. Identifying malleable risk factors that are associated with internalizing problems, such as not having a trusted adult at school, can lead to positive behavior supports to reduce student risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between student-reported internalizing problems and having an adult to talk to at school. Students in elementary, middle, and high school (N = 13,881) in the Midwestern United States provided self-report data about their internalizing symptoms and whether they had an adult to talk to at school if they had a problem. Participants were 51\% male and 72\% White; 40\% qualified for free or reduced lunch and 12\% were in special education. A series of growth models revealed that not having a trusted adult at school was a strong risk factor for internalizing symptoms over the school year. Moreover, lack of a trusted adult was associated with worsening internalizing symptoms over time for middle and high school students. The findings have implications for identifying students and planning supports to alleviate this risk.},

The present study evaluated the consistency of these relations across racial/ethnic student groups using the Authoritative School Climate (ASC) model which defines school climate as a 3-factor model including disciplinary structure, student support, and academic expectations. Data were collected from 5,878 middle/high school students from Missouri and Oklahoma. School-level fixed effects model revealed more negative perception of school climate and higher peer victimization experiences (i.e., general or bullying) amongst racially minoritized groups. Minoritized Racial Identity also negatively moderated the effect between perception of school climate and the selected outcomes with a small to medium effect. These findings may provide further evidence in utilizing Authoritative School Climate Theory in evaluating school climate and implications for educators to establish better teacher–student connections in creating a positive school climate.Impact StatementStudent perceptions of school climate have been shown to be related with the quality of student schooling experience and their respective academic and perception of behavior outcomes. This study evaluated school climate perceptions and found minoritized racial/ethnic status negatively moderated the associations between school climate and bullying victimization experiences with a small to medium effect. These results further help inform educators how establishing positive academic and behavior expectations in school may help mitigate student bullying/victimization experiences in school.},
