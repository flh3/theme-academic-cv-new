abstract: Homogeneity of variance (HOV) is a well-known but often untested assumption
  in the context of multilevel models (MLMs). However, depending on how large the
  violation is, how different group sizes are, and the variance pairing, standard
  errors can be over or underestimated even when using MLMs, resulting in questionable
  inferential tests. We evaluate several tests (e.g., the H statistic, Breusch Pagan,
  Leveneâ€™s test) that can be used with MLMs to assess violations of HOV. Although
  the traditional robust standard errors used with MLMs require at least 50 clusters
  to be effective, we assess a robust standard error adjustment (i.e., the CR2 estimator)
  that can be used even with a few clusters. Findings are assessed using a Monte Carlo
  simulation and are further illustrated using an applied example. We show that explicitly
  modeling the heterogenous variance structures or using the CR2 estimator are both
  effective at ameliorating the issues associated with the fixed effects of the regression
  model related to violations of HOV resulting from between-group differences.
