abstract: Positive perceptions of school climate are associated with improved academic
  and behavioral outcomes, such as lower bullying victimization experience and higher
  student engagement. The present study evaluated the consistency of these relations
  across racial/ethnic student groups using the Authoritative School Climate (ASC)
  model which defines school climate as a 3-factor model including disciplinary structure,
  student support, and academic expectations. Data were collected from 5,878 middle/high
  school students from Missouri and Oklahoma. School-level fixed effects model revealed
  more negative perception of school climate and higher peer victimization experiences
  (i.e., general or bullying) amongst racially minoritized groups. Minoritized Racial
  Identity also negatively moderated the effect between perception of school climate
  and the selected outcomes with a small to medium effect. These findings may provide
  further evidence in utilizing Authoritative School Climate Theory in evaluating
  school climate and implications for educators to establish better teacherâ€“student
  connections in creating a positive school climate.Impact StatementStudent perceptions
  of school climate have been shown to be related with the quality of student schooling
  experience and their respective academic and perception of behavior outcomes. This
  study evaluated school climate perceptions and found minoritized racial/ethnic status
  negatively moderated the associations between school climate and bullying victimization
  experiences with a small to medium effect. These results further help inform educators
  how establishing positive academic and behavior expectations in school may help
  mitigate student bullying/victimization experiences in school.
