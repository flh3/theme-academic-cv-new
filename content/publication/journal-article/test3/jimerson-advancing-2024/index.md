abstract: The intentional and sustained actions to advance diversity, equity, and
  inclusion (DEI) in school psychology science and scholarship, will have reciprocal
  and dynamic influences on graduate preparation and practice. Herein, the School
  Psychology Review leadership team provides reflections on several of our intentional
  efforts, to date, to advocate for and advance DEI in school psychology scholarship,
  and the associated implications for graduate preparation and practice. Contemporary
  actions of the School Psychology Review leadership team have included; (a) establishing
  commitments to advocating for and advancing DEI as the foundation of our scholarship;
  (b) diversifying journal leadership and editorial board members to reflect the diverse
  student body school psychologists serve; (c) preparing future diverse journal leadership
  through mentored editorial fellowship programs, and a student editorial board with
  members from diverse backgrounds; (d) featuring special topics relevant to further
  understanding and supporting diverse and minoritized children, youth, families,
  and school communities; (e) providing professional-development opportunities and
  resources; (f) implementation of Open Science opportunities in the journal, (g)
  implementing triple anonymous peer review to reduce bias, and (h) implementing a
  journal action plan focused on advancing DEI. Collectively these efforts are aimed
  to influence positive change in advancing and sustaining DEI efforts in school psychology
  science, scholarship, graduate preparation and practice.
