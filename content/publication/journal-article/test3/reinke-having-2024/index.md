abstract: Internalizing problems are common mental health concerns among children
  and youth. Identifying malleable risk factors that are associated with internalizing
  problems, such as not having a trusted adult at school, can lead to positive behavior
  supports to reduce student risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association
  between student-reported internalizing problems and having an adult to talk to at
  school. Students in elementary, middle, and high school (N = 13,881) in the Midwestern
  United States provided self-report data about their internalizing symptoms and whether
  they had an adult to talk to at school if they had a problem. Participants were
  51% male and 72% White; 40% qualified for free or reduced lunch and 12% were in
  special education. A series of growth models revealed that not having a trusted
  adult at school was a strong risk factor for internalizing symptoms over the school
  year. Moreover, lack of a trusted adult was associated with worsening internalizing
  symptoms over time for middle and high school students. The findings have implications
  for identifying students and planning supports to alleviate this risk.
