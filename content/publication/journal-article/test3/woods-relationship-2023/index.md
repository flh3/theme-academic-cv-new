abstract: Abstract The present study investigated the relationship between teacher
  stress and job satisfaction, and examined the role of coping as a moderator. Based
  on the transactional and Coping‐Competence‐Context models of stress we expected
  that coping would serve as a protective factor in the relationship between teacher
  stress and their job satisfaction. Stress, coping, and satisfaction were measured
  using single‐item scales which are cost‐effective and practical instruments for
  measuring and monitoring teacher stress. A total of 2347 teachers from 93 schools
  formed the sample for this study. Regression analysis with job satisfaction as the
  outcome, and stress, coping, and their interaction entered separately were used
  to test the primary hypothesis. Results showed that there was a negative correlation
  between stress and job satisfaction, and coping had a significant moderating effect.
  Increasing levels of stress had less of a negative impact on job satisfaction for
  teachers with high coping ratings compared to those with average or low coping ratings.
  Overall, our results suggest that the development of coping skills could be beneficial
  for mitigating the effects of stress on job satisfaction. ,  Practitioner Points    Coping
  is a statistically significant moderator between stress and satisfaction.   As stress
  increases, those with high coping see smaller drops in satisfaction.   Conducted
  using single‐item measures, making it easy for practitioners to utilize.
