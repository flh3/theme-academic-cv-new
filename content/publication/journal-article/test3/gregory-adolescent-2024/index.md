abstract: This study investigated whether a restorative practice initiative improved
  school climate. The study presents findings from a cluster randomized, controlled
  trial conducted with 2,248 students from grades 5 to 12 (38% Black, 32% Hispanic)
  attending 18 schools in the U.S. Northeast. After 1 year of implementation, the
  experimental analyses of the whole-school initiative did not result in more positive
  perceptions of school climate for students in the intervention schools compared
  with students in the control schools. Correlational analyses were also conducted
  with student surveys in both intervention and control schools. Based on student
  report, restorative practice exposure in all 18 schools was associated with positive
  perceptions of the school climate. This suggests that initiatives may need to focus
  on fidelity of implementation and consistent implementation across more years for
  substantive school climate gains.
