abstract: 'Gender minority youth experience bullying victimization at concerningly high rates. The current study sought to unmask potentially unique bullying victimization experiences and perceived prevalence of bullying for Transgender, fluid gender, and gender questioning students. Results revealed that all three gender minority groups were significantly more likely to report being bullied in comparison to cis male students. Transgender and fluid gender students also reported significantly higher prevalence rates of teasing and bullying within their schools. No significant differences between gender minority subgroups were found for either perceived prevalence or bullying victimization experiences. However, Transgender students reported consistently higher rates of victimization in comparison to fluid gender and gender questioning students. Limitations, future directions, and practice implications for school-based personnel are discussed.'
