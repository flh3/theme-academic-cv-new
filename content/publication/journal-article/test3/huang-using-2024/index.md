abstract: Abstract The use of large-scale assessments (LSAs) in education has grown
  in the past decade though analysis of LSAs using multilevel models (MLMs) using
  R has been limited. A reason for its limited use may be due to the complexity of
  incorporating both plausible values and weighted analyses in the multilevel analyses
  of LSA data. We provide additional functions in R that extend the functionality
  of the WeMix (Bailey et al., 2023) package to allow for the automatic pooling of
  plausible values. In addition, functions for model comparisons using plausible values
  and the ability to export output to different formats (e.g., Word, html) are also
  provided.
