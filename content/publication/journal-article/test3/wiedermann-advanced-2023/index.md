abstract: A variety of health and social problems are routinely measured in the form
  of categorical outcome data (such as presence/absence of a problem behavior or stages
  of disease progression). Therefore, proper quantitative analysis of categorical
  data lies at the heart of the empirical work conducted in prevention science. Categorical
  data analysis constitutes a broad dynamic field of methods research and data analysts
  in prevention science can benefit from incorporating recent advances and developments
  in the statistical evaluation of categorical outcomes in their methodological repertoire.
  The present Special Issue, Advanced Categorical Data Analysis in Prevention Science,
  highlights recent methods developments and illustrates their application in the
  context of prevention science. Contributions of the Special Issue cover a wide variety
  of areas ranging from statistical models for binary as well as multi-categorical
  data, advances in the statistical evaluation of moderation and mediation effects
  for categorical data, developments in model evaluation and measurement, as well
  as methods that integrate variable- and person-oriented categorical data analysis.
  The articles of this Special issue make methodological advances in these areas accessible
  to the audience of prevention scientists to maintain rigorous statistical practice
  and decision making. The current paper provides background and rationale for this
  Special Issue, an overview of the articles, and a brief discussion of some potential
  future directions for prevention research involving categorical data analysis.
