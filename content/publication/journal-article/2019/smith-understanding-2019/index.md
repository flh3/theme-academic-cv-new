abstract: Although family–school engagement is important across child and adolescent
  development, most research, programs, and policies have focused primarily on elementary
  students and contexts. The current study extends beyond elementary settings by exploring
  the unique and shared contributions of developmental context on family–school engagement
  (i.e., across and within elementary- and middle-school settings). Data were drawn
  from two randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of teacher training
  in universal classroom-management practices. Participants included 3,174 students
  and 207 teachers across 21 elementary and middle schools in the Midwest. Using hierarchical
  linear modeling, results revealed that family–school engagement was significantly
  higher in elementary than in middle schools. Student-level characteristics (i.e.,
  identifying as White, participation in the free/reduced-price lunch program, and
  having lower levels of disruptive behavior) were also associated with higher levels
  of family–school engagement. In addition, student characteristics (i.e., race/ethnicity
  and level of disruptive behavior) moderated the relations between family–school
  engagement and developmental context. Regardless of developmental context, family–school
  engagement predicted positive end-of-year behavioral outcomes (i.e., increases in
  youth prosocial skills and decreases in youth concentration problems, disruptive
  behaviors, and emotional dysregulation). Last, moderation analyses revealed that
  these effects of family–school engagement were especially pronounced in middle school
  for concentration problems and emotional dysregulation. Overall, findings provide
  further support for the value of family–school engagement across development in
  fostering positive youth outcomes. However, it is evident that more steps must be
  taken to ensure family–school engagement practices are developed to support the
  unique needs of middle-school students and contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
