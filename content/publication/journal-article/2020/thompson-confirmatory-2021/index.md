abstract: The purpose of this paper is to confirm the factor structure, examine the
  invariance, and investigate the predictive validity using disciplinary data for
  5262 high school students who completed the Early Identification System—Student
  Response (EIS-SR). The development and theory of the EIS-SR is discussed along with
  prior work. Building off of prior factor analytic work with a separate sample, it
  was hypothesized the items of the EIS-SR would coalesce into seven factors representing
  Externalizing Behavior, Internalizing Behavior, Peer Relationship Problems, School
  Disengagement, Emotional Dysregulation, Attention and Academic Issues, and Relational
  Aggression. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that EIS-SR scores would be invariant
  with regard to gender and grade level. Lastly, it was hypothesized that students
  with high EIS-SR subscale scores would be predictive of school discipline events.
  Our analyses indicated the EIS-SR did fit the previously observed factor structure
  with the items loading on seven distinct scales. Tests for measurement invariance
  indicated support that the EIS-SR measured the seven factors equally well regardless
  of both gender and grade level. Lastly, EIS-SR subscale scores predicted spring
  office disciplinary referrals, both in and out of school suspensions, and attendance.
