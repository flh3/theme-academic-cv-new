abstract: Teacher emotional factors influence the classroom environment. The purpose
  of the study was to examine the association of teacher emotional exhaustion and
  teacher efficacy with student office discipline referrals (ODRs), in-school suspensions
  (ISSs), and out-of-school suspensions (OSSs) using multilevel logistic regression
  models. The sample included 105 teachers and 1,663 students from nine elementary
  schools in the United States. Higher teacher emotional exhaustion was associated
  with increased use of ODR and ISS but not OSS. For students with teachers experiencing
  burnout, the odds of receiving an ISS increased by a factor of 1.74 (d = .31). Greater
  teacher efficacy was also associated with lower use of OSS but not ODR or ISS. The
  results suggest that improving teacher efficacy and reducing teacher emotional exhaustion
  may support the reduced use of exclusionary discipline practices.
