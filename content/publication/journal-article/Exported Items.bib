Previous studies have explored the negative implications of corruption on several aspects of human development, but, despite its serious and long-lasting consequences, the impact of corruption on educational outcomes has started to receive attention only in recent years. This study empirically investigates the relationship between corruption and educational outcomes, using a sample of 50 countries. Study findings show that corruption is negatively associated with educational outcomes, after controlling for other variables, and suggest that continued efforts be made to control corruption.

	abstract = {Black students are much more likely to be disciplined using out-of-school suspensions (OSS) compared with White students. One often-cited hypothesis, though relatively untested, is the role of misconduct and students attitudes that support deviant behavior. The differential involvement hypothesis suggests that disproportionate sanctioning may result if one group of students is engaged in greater levels of misbehavior compared with the other group. Using a national high school dataset, the author used various student-reported measures of misconduct (e.g., fighting) and 18 attitudes supporting deviant behavior (e.g., it is okay to disobey school rules) to investigate their association with receiving an OSS. Findings showed that misconduct and deviant attitudes were important factors in predicting the receipt of OSS though results indicated that Black students did not generally misbehave or endorse deviant attitudes more than White students did.},

	abstract = {Out-of-school suspension (OSS), particularly for Black students, is recognized as a serious concern given the many negative consequences associated with being removed from school. This study tested the hypothesis that an authoritative school climate (ASC), characterized by strict but fair discipline and supportive teacher-student relationships, was associated with a lower likelihood of suspensions. Logistic regression models were used to analyze cross-sectional, student-report survey data from a statewide sample of 75,081 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students from 310 middle schools. Results indicated that, after controlling for student and school characteristics, higher ASC was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving an OSS. The beneficial association of an ASC did not vary differentially by student race/ethnicity.},
