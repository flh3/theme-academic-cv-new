      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Professor in the Department of Educational, School, and Counseling Psychology (emphasis: Statistics, Measurement, & Evaluation in Education) Program in the College of Education and Human Development at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I am an applied quantitative methodologist and currently teach courses related to program (impact) evaluation, multilevel modeling, regression, and data management. My research interests focus on the use of applied quantitative methods for policy analysis (e.g., bullying, school violence), school climate, large scale data analysis, and the development and validation of empirically supported measures and scales. My methodological interest focus on the analysis of clustered data (or dealing with nonindependent data structures) and the design and analysis of experiments.
