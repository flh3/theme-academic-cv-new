 abstract = {The beneficial relationship of school climate with various positive student outcomes has been demonstrated in several studies, though the relationship has not been thoroughly explored with regards to a studentâ€™s likelihood of being suspended from school. The relationship of school climate and out-of-school suspensions was investigated using a nationally-representative sample of 10th grade students. Regression results, which included student- and school-level factors, indicated that an authoritative school climate, characterized by an environment with fair and just rules, was associated with the reduced likelihood of suspensions, over and above other predictors. Although the relationship may be characterized as small (OR = 0.82), the positive benefits to students are likely cumulative over each year the student is in school.},
